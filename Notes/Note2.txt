I have a time series data of ridership of number of validation on the train stations from 2017-2023 years. Here is the key findings I found:
From 2017-2023: the number of validaition are high
From 2020-2021: the number of validation drops significantly
From 2021-2023: it rise gradually
In 2017, there is a lot of outliers on first, second, third and sixth months
in every year, on August, the number of validations is mostly lowest
the holidays data are mostly from the seven, eight months, the last period of december, first period of january, end and beginning between April and May.

Requirements:
Apply appropriate simple statistical methods to validate findings and draw meaningful insights from the data.
Use statistical tests to assess the significance of observed variations, when possible

What i need to do now in R for the requirements with my key findings?
